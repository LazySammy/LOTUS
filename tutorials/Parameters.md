# Parameters
This is an exhaustive description of all possible parameters of [LOncoG](../).\
These parameters need to be filled in the configuration file (```config.txt```) before running LOncoG.\
You can find an example of a configuration file [here](../tutorials/config_example.txt).\
Each parameter must be filled in the configuration file before running the pipeline.\
```<Name of parameter> = <required option>```
> module(s) = Filter, Summarise

When a parameter have several options (not a yes/no parameter), you can choose several of them by separating them with a comma.\
```C_SNP_profile_format(s) = png, jpg, svg``` will output the plot in png, jpg and svg formats.

When a parameter is a yes/no parameter, you can choose only one of the two options.
Concerning tables, xlsx is always recommended, as it allows to have pre-formatted more lisible tables.

游댯 Key parameter\
游릭 Secondary parameter

## Global arguments
Here are some key arguments about the program in general, and also about input and output folders.

### LOncoG
#### 游댯 ```module(s)```
- Choose the module(s) you want to run:
    - **Filter** the variants among their sequencing quality and allelic frequency
    - **Summarise** the filtered variants (statistics, mutation types, mutated genes, etc)
    - **Compare** the filtered variants from time 1 and time 2 for each patient
    - **Merge** the comparisons results together, to get a cross analysis of all patients
- Options: 
  - ```Filter, Summarise, Compare, Merge``` 驕놾잺 
  - ```Filter```
  - ```Summarise```
  - ```Compare```
  - ```Merge```


#### 游댯 ```output_folder_path```
- Choose the path where you want to save the results of the analysis:
    - **new** > creates a new folder in "output" folder with date as a name (format : YYYY-MM-DD)
    - **<your path>** > creates a new folder located at the path specified
    > Note: if you already ran Filter and Summarise in a folder, you can use its path to complete it with Compare and Merge analysis
    (if you choose to run Filter or Summarise again, it will overwrite the previous results if you don't change the folderpath)
- Options: 
  - ```new``` 驕놾잺 
  - ```<you path>```

#### 游댯 ```discard_weak_variants```
- Choose if you want to keep the variants that don't pass the filter you chose:
    - **Yes** > the variants that don't pass the filter you chose are removed (strong variants)
    - **Summarise** > the variants that don't pass the filter you chose are kept (weak variants)
- Options: 
  - ```yes``` 驕놾잺 
  - ```no```

#### 游댯 ```keep_filtered_vcf_after_run```
- After FILTER execution, filtered vcf files are created (indicate which variants did pass the filter), but
  you can save a lot of space by removing them when no more required:
    - **yes** > the filtered vcf files are kept in the "samples" subfolder (in your output folder)
    - **no** > the filtered vcf files are removed after the execution of Compare module
- Options: 
  - ```no``` 驕놾잺 
  - ```yes```
  > Caution! Summarise and Compare modules need the filtered vcf files to be correctly run!
  (if you removed the filtered vcf files by error, and you run Summarise or Compare, it will re-run Filter module)

#### 游댯 ```variants_selection_approach```
- Choose the method you want to use to select the variants to keep:
    - **change** > the variants that appeared or disappeared between times are selected
    - **common** > the variants that are common between times are selected
    - **all** > all the variants are selected (found in time 1, time 2, or both)
- Options: 
  - ```change``` 驕놾잺 
  - ```common```
  - ```all```
  > ```change``` is advised, so you can study variants that may have a relation with the disease evolution or treatment response.

#### 游댯 ```remove_non_driver_mutations```
- If you want to remove the non-driver mutations from the filtered variants, fill ```yes```.
Non driver mutations are 'non frameshift', 'synonymous' mutation subtypes from ANNOVAR.
'stopgain', 'stoploss', 'frameshift' SNPs and indels are considered as driver mutations.
For example: ```ExonicFunc.refGene=nonframeshift_deletion``` will be filtered out if 'yes' is selected.
- Options: 
  - ```yes``` 驕놾잺 
  - ```no```

- Options: 
  - ```input/vcf/``` 驕놾잺 
  - ```<your_path>```

#### 游댯 ```dataset_path```

- Options: 
  - ```input/dataset.xlsx``` 驕놾잺 
  - ```<your_path>```

  - ```time1``` 驕놾잺 
  - ```<your_column_name_for_time1>```
  
#### 游댯 ```time2_column_name```

- Options: 
  - ```time2``` 驕놾잺 
  - ```<your_column_name_for_time2>```

#### 游릭 ```pair_names_column_name```
- In your table, you can add an optional column of pair names, that LOncoG will display in analysis results (plots, etc):
  - **<your_column_name_for_pairs_names>** > you can put your patients ids there, the outputs will be clearer (short names)
  - **none** > if you don't have a column with pair names, we will use ```file_time1_name___file_time2_name``` as pair id (very long names)
- Options: 
  - ```patients``` 驕놾잺 
  - ```<your_column_name_for_pairs_names>```
  - ```none```

### Execution
#### 游릭 ```log```

  - ```LOncoG.log``` 驕놾잺 
  - ```<your_log_file_name>```

- Options: 
  - ```no``` 驕놾잺 
  - ```yes```

#### 游릭 ```colored_execution```
- During LOncoG running, the information appearing in the console can be colored or not:
    - **yes** > the information will be colored in the console (recommanded for recent consoles such as VSCode, PyCharm, etc)
    - **no** > the information will not be colored in the console (recommanded for old consoles such as PyScripter, etc)
- Options: 
  - ```yes``` 驕놾잺 
  - ```no```
